"""
The data file has each dream report and the corresponding
open-ended questions within each row.

For the qualitative peak into the open-ended questions and
how they relate to dreams and lucidity (DLQ1) ratings, it's
better to have them in a more digestible structure.

So here, take each night's dream report, open question
responses, and DLQ1 response, and export 2 text files:
    1. one that lists responses to each open question, grouped by DLQ1
        So OpenQs > DLQ1 > response
        <open_questions-by_probe.txt>
    2. one that groups all open questions by lucidity rating
        Sp DLQ1 > OpenQs > response
        <open_questions-by_response.txt>
